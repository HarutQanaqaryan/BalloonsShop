# Hello. This is my first project in pure html, css, and a little bit of javascript.

*I decided to create a business card site for an online balloon store for my city, where I live, because I have been designing holidays for a long time.*

### My site consists of three pages

1. The main page (where I tell about our company, reviews
2. Catalog
3. Delivery and payment


### There are 5 folders in the repository, and 3 files
